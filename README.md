# Chat
A project from jan 2017, that I almost forgot I did, that uses threads and sockets to make a chat. 
Run the Server class from the server package, then open the Client class from the client package and change the server ip to the ip of the computer with the server(or localhost if the server is on the same computer).
Then run the Client class. Enter display name in the console, enter "1337" for password. Do the same thing for another client and start typing.
It should work.
